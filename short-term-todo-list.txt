This is a random short term todo list. Items written here are subject to discussion.
Feel free to ask on nemiver-list@gna.org about particular topics that you may be interested to take over.

1) Add I18n support to the project.

2) Once attached to the debugger, popup a dialog telling the user she can set breakpoints before hiting the "run" button.
That dialog can propose to open files to set the breakpoints.

3) Display a nice "where-marker" for the cases where the classical "where-marker" (the arrow) and the breakpoint marker (the red circle)
   are on the same line. Today, this is not precisely handled so it looks very ugly.

4) add support for loading core files and showing the stack trace.

5) write a gdb command interpreter widget (prolly based on Gtk::TextView), using IDebugger. It should accept commands with the same syntax as the classical
   gdb syntax and call IDebugger in the background.

6) write a local variables visualisation widget based on the new local variable listing api added to IDebugger. [started by Dodji.]

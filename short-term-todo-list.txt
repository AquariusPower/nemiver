This is a random short term todo list. Items written here are subject to discussion.
Feel free to ask on nemiver-list@gna.org about particular topics that you may be interested to take over.

1) Once attached to the debugger, popup a dialog telling the user she can set breakpoints before hiting the "run" button.
That dialog can propose to open files to set the breakpoints.

2) Display a nice "where-marker" for the cases where the classical "where-marker" (the arrow) and the breakpoint marker (the red circle)
   are on the same line. Today, this is not precisely handled so it looks very ugly.

3) write a gdb command interpreter widget (prolly based on Gtk::TextView), using IDebugger. It should accept commands with the same syntax as the classical
   gdb syntax and call IDebugger in the background.

4) finish the variable visualization widget so that it shows global variables as well.

5) Make what's in the "debug" menu show up in a contextual menu (the menu that pops up when the user right clicks on the source editor)

6) in the "load core file" workflow, grey out debugging actions that don't
make sense like those related to stepping and breakpoint setting.

7) code a thread selection tab in the status notebook.

8) add 'continue to current line' and 'jump to current line'.

9) add a search facility to search text in the source editor, also maybe add find in files.

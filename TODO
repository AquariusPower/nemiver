This is a random short term todo list. Items written here are subject to discussion.
Feel free to ask on nemiver-list@gna.org about particular topics that you may be interested to take over.

*) add show/hide line numbers in preferences [pre 0.1]

*) write a gdb command interpreter widget (prolly based on Gtk::TextView),
   using IDebugger. It should accept commands with the
   same syntax as the classical gdb syntax and call IDebugger in the background.

*) add a search facility to search text in the source editor,
   also maybe add find in files.

*) Change the color of variables in the 'locals' and 'watch' widgets when their
    values change between one break and the next

*) Once attached to the debugger, popup a dialog telling the
   user she can set breakpoints before hiting the "run" button.
   That dialog can propose to open files to set the breakpoints.

*) Display a nice "where-marker" for the cases where the classical
   "where-marker" (the arrow) and the breakpoint marker (the red circle)
   are on the same line. Today, this is not precisely
   handled so it looks very ugly.

*) in the "load core file" workflow, grey out debugging actions that don't
   make sense like those related to stepping and breakpoint setting.

*) Add a variable "Watch" widget so that the user can inspect the values of
    arbitrary variables

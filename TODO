This is a random short term todo list. Items written here are subject to discussion.
Feel free to ask on nemiver-list@gna.org about particular topics that you may be interested to take over.

*) make VarsEditor more effective: it shouldn't clear and set all the variables each time
   the debugger stops. It should instead detect when several stops occur in the same function.
   In that case, it should update the value of a variable only if it has changed.

*) Change the color of variables in the 'locals' and 'watch' widgets when their
    values change between one break and the next

*) write a gdb command interpreter widget (prolly based on Gtk::TextView),
   using IDebugger. It should accept commands with the
   same syntax as the classical gdb syntax and call IDebugger in the background.

*) add a search facility to search text in the source editor,
   also maybe add find in files.

*) Add a variable "Watch" widget so that the user can inspect the values of
    arbitrary variables

*) Once attached to the debugger, popup a dialog telling the
   user she can set breakpoints before hiting the "run" button.
   That dialog can propose to open files to set the breakpoints.

*) Display a nice "where-marker" for the cases where the classical
   "where-marker" (the arrow) and the breakpoint marker (the red circle)
   are on the same line. Today, this is not precisely
   handled so it looks very ugly.

*) in the "load core file" workflow, grey out debugging actions that don't
   make sense like those related to stepping and breakpoint setting.

*) add a plugin to list all of the source files that make up the current
   executable so that you can easily open them by double-clicking their names
   rather than searching the filesystem (using -file-list-exec-source-files)

*) Add ability to show disassembly of the source

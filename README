About
=====
Nemiver is an project to write a standalone graphical debugger that integrates
well in the GNOME desktop.
It uses the well known GNU Debugger gdb.

AMD64 issues:
=============
If you compile nemiver on a 64-bit architecture such as amd64, you may get
something like the following error:

/usr/bin/ld: .libs/nmv-ustring.o: relocation R_X86_64_PC32 against
`std::basic_ostringstream<char, std::char_traits<char>, std::allocator<char>
>::basic_ostringstream(std::_Ios_Openmode)@@GLIBCXX_3.4' can not be used when
making a shared object; recompile with -fPIC

You can get around this by configuring nemiver with the
`--disable-symbolsvisibilitycontrol' option

    <title>Debug a running program</title>

    <p>This method is to use when you need to debug a program you can't stop,
    because you're not sure you will be able to reproduce the conditions that
    cause the bug for instance.</p>

    <section id="interface">
        <title>From <app>Nemiver</app> interface</title>

        <p>To debug a program which is currently running, choose
        <guiseq><gui>File</gui>, <gui>Attach to Running Programâ€¦</gui></guiseq>,
        then select the program you want to debug in the list, and choose
        <gui>OK</gui>. You can narrow the list of programs by entering part of
        the target program you look for.</p>

        <title>From command-line</title>
        <p>From a terminal, you can start directly a debugging session, type
        <cmd>nemiver --attach</cmd><var>program_name</var> where
        <var>program_name</var> is the program you want to debug.
        <var>program_name</var> can also be the Process ID of the program.</p>

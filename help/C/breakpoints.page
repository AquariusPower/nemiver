        <title>Set a breakpoint</title>

        <p><app>Nemiver</app> set a first breakpoint at the beginning of the
        <code>main()</code> function when you start to debug a program.</p>
        <p>Setting other breakpoints can be done these ways:</p>
        <list>
            <item><p>Place your cursor on a line where you want the breakpoint
            to be set and set the breakpoint by either selecting
            <guiseq><gui>Debug</gui><gui>Toggle Breakpoint at
            cursor</gui></guiseq>, or by pressing <key>F8</key>.</p></item>
            <item><p>Click in the margin next to the line where you want the
            breakpoint to be set.</p></item>
            <item><p>Set a breakpoint at a specific function name or at a
            specific location in a file by selecting
            <guiseq><gui>Debug</gui><gui>Set Breakpoint â€¦</gui></guiseq> or by
            pressing <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>B</key></keyseq>.</p></item>
        </list>

        <p>When a breakpoint is set, you should see a red dot next to the
        corresponding line, on the left-hand side of the source file.</p>

        <comment><p>Need to explain that you can set breakpoint not only on line
        number, but in various other ways, see Ctrl+B dialog.</p></comment>

    <section id="disable-breakpoint">
        <title>Disable a breakpoint</title>

        <p>Should you do not need a breakpoint just for a while, you can
        temporarly disable it rather than deleting it.</p>
        <p>To do so, you can use theses methods</p>
        <list>
            <item><p>Choose
            <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Breakpoints</gui></guiseq> to display
            the list of breakpoints for the current session, and untick the
            <gui>checkbox</gui> next to the breakpoint you want to
            disable.</p></item>
            <item><p>Place your cursor on a line where there is the breakpoint
            to disable, and choose <guiseq><gui>Debug</gui><gui>Disable
            Breakpoint</gui></guiseq>. You can also use the shortcut
            <keyseq><key>Shift</key><key>F8</key></keyseq>.</p></item>
        </list>
        <p>A disabled breakpoint will be diplayed as a white dot next to the
        corresponding line.</p>

    <section id="delete-breakpoint">
        <title>Delete a breakpoint</title>

        <list>
            <item><p>Place your cursor on a line where there is the breakpoint
            to delete, and choose <guiseq><gui>Debug</gui><gui>Remove 
            Breakpoint</gui></guiseq>. You can also use the shortcut
            <key>F8</key>.</p></item>
            <item><p>Click on the red dot in the margin next to the line which
            contains the breakpoint to remove.</p></item>
            <item><p>Choose
            <guiseq><gui>View</gui><gui>Breakpoints</gui></guiseq> to display
            the list of breakpoints for the current session, right-click the
            breakpoint to remove, and choose <gui>Delete</gui>.</p></item>

        <title>Breakpoint types</title>

        <section id="type-breakpoint">
            <title>Breakpoint</title>
            <p>Breakpoint is a marker you set on a program, and when this marker
            is reached, the program is stopped to permit to observe its state
            at this step.</p>
            <p>In <app>Nemiver</app> you can set breakpoint on a source code
            line but also on function, on source code, on memory address or on
            events like <code>fork()</code>.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="type-conditional-breakpoint">
            <title>Conditional breakpoint</title>
            <p>Conditional breakpoints are breakpoints triggered under a defined
            condition, for instance you can set the breakpoint only if a variable
            has a wanted value.</p>
            <example>
            <p>For the following source code:</p>
                <code mime="text/x-csrc">
int i = 0;
char b = 1;
i = b + 1;
b = 2;</code>
            <p>You can set the following conditionnal breakpoint to break when
            b equals 1:</p>
            <code>b == 1</code>
            </example>
        </section>

        <section id="type-countpoints">
            <title>Countpoints</title>
            <p>Countpoints are specific type of breakpoint, as they count the number
            of time the program run through this mark, and increment a counter,
            called <gui>Hits</gui>.</p>
            <p>Countpoints have a blue dot on the left side next the line in the
            source code view.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="type-watchpoints">
            <title>Watchpoints</title>
            <p>Watchpoints are similar to breakpoints, however they are set on
            variables rather than on line of code or functions.</p>

        <title>What is a session</title>
        <p>A session includes saving information such as which executable is
        being debugged, what environment variables are set, what command-line
        options are passed to the executable, which files are open, and which
        breakpoints are set so that you can get back to where you left off last
        time as quickly as possible.</p>

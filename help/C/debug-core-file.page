    <title>Debug a program using a core file</title>

    <p>This method is to use when a program has already crashed and you need to
    understand afterwards what happened. This method requires the crash created
    a core file.</p>

    <p>To debug a core file, choose <guiseq><gui>File</gui>, <gui>Load Core
    Fileâ€¦</gui></guiseq>, then a new window appears:</p> <list>
    <item><p><gui>Core File</gui>, choose the core file you want to
    debug.</p></item> <item><p><gui>Executable</gui>, choose the executable file
    that generate the core file. It should be the same exact version.</p></item>
    </list>

        <title>What is a core file</title>

        <p>A core file is a file that contains a detail description of a program
        when it crashed. It's useful to do a post-mortem analysis after a crash
        in order to reproduce it and correct the underlaying problem that
        introduced the 
        crash.</p>

        <title>If no core file is generated on program crash?</title>

        <p>If no core file is generated when a program crash, you have to check
        if they are permitted on your system.</p>
        <p>Open a terminal, and enter the command <input>ulimit -c</input>, if
        the value returned is <output>0</output>, then it means core won't be
        generated on a program crash.</p>
        <p>To permit core file generation, edit the file <file>.bashrc</file> in
        your <sys>$HOME</sys> directory and add a line <code>ulimit -c
        unlimited</code> and save the file.</p>
        <p>To have this setting applied you have to logout from your session and
        login back again.</p>
